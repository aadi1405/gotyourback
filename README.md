# GOT YOUR BACK
Hello Everyone, I got my acceptance from Columbia University and Duke University! Wish I had a one-stop guide for applying to universities before I began the process, hence created this Repo which will be helpful for students applying for Masters programs, particularly in USA.

A repo where I keep adding content [mainly resources] which may help students pursue their masters program! :)

Make sure to start your application on the college website and create your login, this allows you to see the requirements and prepare. Everything in this repo is based on personal experience and is just meant to be a general guide, it is not necessary that this is the only fixed route to follow!

# GRE Prep 
[GRE has been made optional/not required in several universities for different programs, make sure to check the university requirements]
GRE scores are used by admissions or fellowship panels to supplement your undergraduate records, recommendation letters and other qualifications for graduate-level study. They provide schools with a common measure for comparison. [According to ETS]
